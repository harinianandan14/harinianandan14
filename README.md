Hi, I’m Harini Anandan 👩💻
AI Code Whisperer | LLM Explorer | Prompt Artist | Self-Taught Project Sorcerer 🪄

I talk to machines for a living—yes, literally. I tell AI my wildest project ideas, and it helps me figure out the "how" (think: digital Yoda for nerds). 🗣️➡️🤖

What I actually do:
🔎 Pattern Detective: Spot patterns in brain data using AI (no mind-reading...yet).
📚 LLM Sidekick: Build smart Q&A tools that actually understand your docs.
📊 Prompt Scientist: Compare prompts like a data-obsessed taste-tester.

Stack I juggle:
🐍 Python | ☕ Java | 🔗 LangChain

Certified (and still very curious):
🏅 LangChain for LLM Dev (DeepLearningAI)
🌩️ AWS & IBM GenAI (Prompt Engineering side quests)

I learn by doing:
📖 No teachers, just me, docs, and a never-ending playlist of tutorials.
🔮 Future goal: Make AI so easy, even your coffee machine could use it.
