<h1>Hi, I’m Harini Anandan 👩💻</h1>
<h3>AI Code Whisperer | LLM Explorer | Prompt Artist | Self-Taught Project Sorcerer 🪄</h3>

I talk to machines for a living—yes, literally. I tell AI my wildest project ideas, and it helps me figure out the "how" (think: digital Yoda for nerds). 🗣️➡️🤖

<h3>What I actually do:</h3>

🔎 Pattern Detective: Spot patterns in brain data using AI (no mind-reading...yet).

📚 LLM Sidekick: Build smart Q&A tools that actually understand your docs.

📊 Prompt Scientist: Compare prompts like a data-obsessed taste-tester.

<h3>Stack I juggle:</h3>

🐍 Python | ☕ Java | 🔗 LangChain

<h3>Certified (and still very curious):</h3>

🏅 LangChain for LLM Dev (DeepLearningAI)

🌩️ AWS & IBM GenAI (Prompt Engineering side quests)

<h3>I learn by doing:</h3>

📖 No teachers, just me, docs, and a never-ending playlist of tutorials.

🔮 Future goal: Make AI so easy, even your coffee machine could use it.

<h3>Let’s team up:</h3>
